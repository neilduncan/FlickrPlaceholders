FlickrPlaceholders
==================

Web service using Flask to provide placeholder images based on Flickr search

Setup
-----
I've included a virtual Python environment for this project using `virtualenv`.

To install `virtualenv` using `pip`.

    pip install virtualenv
    
Start up the environment.
  
    source venv/bin/activate
   
When you are finished, deactivate it to get back your normal Python environment.

    deactivate
